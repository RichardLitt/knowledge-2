-   traditional electronic music, as an instrument, is heavily loop-based. You have a loop and you can do stuff to it.
-   what if we made something that was still "pattern-based" but let you play it more like an instrument?

-   web audio
-   define a pattern, which can be transposed to different chords / intervals
-   use 3 keyboard keys: prev / curr / next
-   keys play a note, advancing in the pattern as you use `next`
-   other keys transpose the pattern, so you can effectively play the same role as rythym guitar
