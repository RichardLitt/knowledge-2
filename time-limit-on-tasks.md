# [](#time-limit-on-tasks)Time limit on tasks

idea: when starting a task, set a time limit (and use an actual timer).

-   Remove as many distractions as possible during that time
-   when the time is up, you're not allowed to keep going or start the clock again. Must change to some other task.
-   the purpose of this constraint is to condition myself to work deliberately, thinking about the cost before going into it. If something turns out to take longer than I expected, it shifts the emphasis from _"just keep going until it's done"_ to _"spend the remaining time organising things better, so that when I next come to this task I'll be able to approach it more predictably"_.

-   30 minutes is a good starting place for new tasks that I'm not sure about. That's enough time to either complete a short task, or prepare myself for a longer one.

-   it's ok to go past the timer if you're just doing final stages of wrapup, sending email, etc. But shouldn't go beyond a couple of minutes, and shouldn't introduce anything new.
