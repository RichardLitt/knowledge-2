# generosity in scarcity

- "where your treasure is, there your heart will be also"
  - [matthew 6:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6&version=NIV)
- the things we most easily give our resources to are the things we treasure the most.
- if someone considers themselves a christian:
  - they are called to give out of their firstfruits (rather than out of their leftovers).
  - they are called to check their privilege: you didn't earn money or status with hard work, it was given to you.
