<li>one way to gather requirements is to make a list of &quot;facts&quot; about how the system works.</li>
<li>these might also have accompanying notes to clarify edge cases</li>
<li>then whenever developing a feature, writing a QA script, or reporting a bug, try to refer to as many of these facts as possible</li>
<li>need a good way to search for them</li>
<li>should make it really easy to add new facts, even if there is some overlap</li>
<li>too confusing to try and describe the entire system in prose, but this way of describing the system is like pointalism: as we add more and more of these points, the whole picture begins to emerge</li>
<li>still useful to categorise things into sections / screens</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#annotate-screenshots"></a>Annotate screenshots</h2><ul>
<li>rather than having to manually name each thing when you describe it, we need to be able to say &quot;this thing&quot; and point to an area in an image file.</li>
