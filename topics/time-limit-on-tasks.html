        <h1><a href="#time-limit-on-tasks"></a>Time limit on tasks</h1><p>idea: when starting a task, set a time limit (and use an actual timer).</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove as many distractions as possible during that time</li>
<li>when the time is up, you&#39;re not allowed to keep going or start the clock again. Must change to some other task.</li>
<li><p>the purpose of this constraint is to condition myself to work deliberately, thinking about the cost before going into it. If something turns out to take longer than I expected, it shifts the emphasis from <em>&quot;just keep going until it&#39;s done&quot;</em> to <em>&quot;spend the remaining time organising things better, so that when I next come to this task I&#39;ll be able to approach it more predictably&quot;</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>30 minutes is a good starting place for new tasks that I&#39;m not sure about. That&#39;s enough time to either complete a short task, or prepare myself for a longer one.</p>
</li>
<li><p>it&#39;s ok to go past the timer if you&#39;re just doing final stages of wrapup, sending email, etc. But shouldn&#39;t go beyond a couple of minutes, and shouldn&#39;t introduce anything new.</p>
</li>
</ul>
