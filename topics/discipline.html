<li>there is &quot;skill&quot; and then there is &quot;discipline&quot;</li>
<li>as with any habit-forming, consistency is greater than quantity. Everyone can start with <em>something</em> and build upon that.</li>
<li>just like in physical training there are things we can do to help people form that discipline. A clear guideline that&#39;s easy to follow, and someone who will check up on you, that you are accountable to.</li>
<li>these 2 things (clear guideline &amp; accountability) will also help us to avoid &quot;the slump&quot;. As a project matures or deadlines encroach, disciplines can slip. Or a dev might spend 8 hours debugging something, which only equates to 1 line of code. Somebody needs to be there alongside them pushing through the tough patch. But the end result is growth.
