# annotating text

Q. how can you make annotations on specific lines of a file?

- option: heading references in comments
  - pro: encourages meaninginful headings and structure of requirements docs
  - depends on unique headings, which is not too tricky.

- option: heading reference in commit
  - pro: similar to idea of "fixes: #33" in github

- option: copy/paste an identifiable chunk into code
  - con: might have some unusual edge cases
