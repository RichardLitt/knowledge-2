idea: variant of markdown which can include jsx components.

## why?

- might be a useful way to write documents that contain a mixture of prose & data, and that can be used in rich visualizations.
- i always run into walls when trying to stretch markdown too far. In a lot of cases I'd rather just use plain markdown, and use jsx for more complicated things.
