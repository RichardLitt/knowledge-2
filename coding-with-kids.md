## scratch: Code with Anna and Elsa

<https://studio.code.org/s/frozen/stage/1/puzzle/1>

- started this with my daughter (6), and she is really loving it after the first few puzzles.
- there's some nice intro to geometry & angles, as well as thinking in patterns.
- i like how it works with experimental play (eg. "What happens if i change this?") as well as encouraging to run the simulation in your head, and then use the computer to confirm your expectations.
