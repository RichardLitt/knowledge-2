## [](#test-suite)test suite

Goals:

-   develop a suite of end-to-end tests that cover all css-modules functionality
-   run the same test cases in different implementations (eg. webpack / browserify)
-   provide a simple "how to" reference for different things you can do with css-modules

## [](#questions)questions

-   Q. why does editing a shared css file rebuild correctly, but editing the main one include _everything_ in the bundle?

-   Q. how does it go with a .css.js module?

-   Q. would icss be better as a js module that exports objects?
